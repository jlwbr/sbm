## SBM

SBM is a stack based programming language heavily inspired by [Porth](https://github.com/tsoding/porth) and [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)), it is primarily intended to be used as a language for programming [AVR microcontrollers](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmel_AVR)

SBM will be:
- [x] Stack-based (just like Forth)
- [ ] Able to simulate an AVR enviroment on every platform that Julia runs
- [ ] Able to cross-compile to AVR Assembly
- [ ] Turing-complete
- [ ] Statically typed (similar to [WASM validation](https://binji.github.io/posts/webassembly-type-checking/))
